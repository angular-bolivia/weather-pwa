# Weather App (PWA)

As an Angular Community we'll start coding our first [Progressive Web Application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

We'll use latest version of

* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io)
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io)

# Running Application
## Prerequisites

First, make sure you have following software installed:

1. NodeJS - Download and Install latest `LTS` version of Node: [NodeJS](http://http://nodejs.org)
2. Git - Download and Install [Git](http://git-scm.com)
3. Angular CLI - Install Command Line Interface for Angular [https://cli.angular.io/](https://cli.angular.io/)

This project was generated with `Angular CLI` version 1.1.2.

## Angular CLI help

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


# Public APIs
Since the focus of this project is build an Angular App, we'll use public APIs to display required data.
We'll add more information about this soon.
